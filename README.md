# gaugan
An automator for generating multiple frames through Nvidia's GauGAN.
Please remember that I am not a coder and the person who created this for me has disappeared from the internet apparently.

Create a folder and place gaugan.py in it.
Create two folders inside as well, one named 'In' and one named 'Out'
Place your input maps in the in folder.
In the terminal, navigate to the location of your folder containing the above.
This script uses Python3 and on my Mac I have to type the instruction this way:
  python3 gaugan.py -s #
// where # is the style from the GauGAN web app from left to right starting with 0.
Your output images will be placed in the Out folder.

I'd love to see your creations!
